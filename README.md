This project has a primary objective: to raise awareness about the importance of responsible consumer choices, particularly in the context of boycotting. We aim to address a significant issue - the widespread lack of fact-checking and awareness regarding the actions of companies in various conflicts. Often, people are unaware of how their support for a particular brand or platform can impact broader issues. Our project is designed to inform individuals about the ongoing developments and empower them to make informed decisions based on accurate information, rather than relying on unverified internet rumors.
